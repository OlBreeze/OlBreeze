- 👋 Hi, I’m Olga.
- 👀 I graduated from a humanities gymnasium and entered the aviation university, after which I became interested in programming and participated in the full cycle of project development
 for the financial sector of an energy company.
 I worked as an Oracle database administrator for more than ten years.
 At some point, I was offered a large project for the development of accounting programs on 1C.
 I led and supported more than 20 companies, received a huge number of thanks and positive reviews.
  Now I am engaged in software development on Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux...
- 🌱 I'm currently learning course Full Stack Java at Tel-Ran. I'm excited about gaining hands-on experience and deepening my understanding of software development processes.
- 💞️ I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects that allow me to develop my skills and apply my knowledge in practice.
 I'm also interested in internships where I can gain valuable experience and contribute to a team.
 If you have any ideas or suggestions, I’d be happy to discuss!

- ⚡ Fun fact: When I read Arthur Hailey's book "Airport," I dreamed of becoming a pilot.
  I was accepted into the aviation institute without a competition and was
  quite surprised to learn that after graduation, I would become an engineer, not a pilot!

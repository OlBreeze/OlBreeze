# 😏 A bit of coding mischief I got into:  

### https://github.com/OlBreeze/library-microservices  

Built a microservices-based library management system with separate authentication 
and data services. Implemented JWT stateless authentication, Docker containerization, 
comprehensive API documentation via Swagger, and full CRUD operations with filtering 
and pagination using Django REST Framework.

```
🔐 Microservices architecture (Auth + Books services)
🐳 Docker containerization & orchestration
🔑 JWT stateless authentication between services
📚 Full CRUD with filtering, search & pagination
📖 Auto-generated Swagger/OpenAPI docs
✅ Unit tests & admin panel
```

--- 
### https://github.com/OlBreeze/jwt-file-system  

Designed and implemented a two-microservice system that securely communicates via JWT-authenticated HTTP requests. 
One service continuously monitors a local directory, detects new files, extracts metadata, and sends it securely to the second service for processing and storage.

```
🧩 Two-microservice architecture (File Watcher + Metadata Processor)  
🔑 Secure inter-service communication with JWT authentication  
📁 Automatic file detection and metadata extraction  
📨 Asynchronous data transfer between services  
⚙️ End-to-end file lifecycle management  
🐳 Dockerized setup for isolated service environments  
✅ Configurable logging and error handling  
```
